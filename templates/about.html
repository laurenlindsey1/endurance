      <h1>Endurance</h1>
        <p>Endurance is a webapp that functions as an online fitness journal. With Endurance you can upload and store your customized workout routines for later access. If you do not wish to create your own routine you may use one of the routines Endurance provides. In addition to storing routines, exercises suggested by Endurance link directly to short YouTube videos that will demonstrate how to perform each exercise. After completing your workout routine, you can input the type of exercise you have done along with the quantity and Endurance will record this amount. Once you have completed a certain number of exercises, Endurance will automatically award you an accomplishment to ensure that you remain motivated. You may access your exercise stats and accomplishments at any time. </p>
